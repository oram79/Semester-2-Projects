          <p>
            Jeep is an American car brand known for its rough terrain vehicles.
            The organization's foundations follow back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">World War II</a>, where
            its ancestors created military vehicles. After the conflict, Jeep
            changed into making regular citizen forms of its tough, go-anyplace
            vehicles.One of Jeep's generally notorious models is the Jeep Wrangler,
            which holds a large part of the first Jeep plan ethos with its square shaped
            shape, removable entryways, and tough <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-wheel_drive">four-wheel-drive</a> abilities. It's a number
            one among rough terrain lovers for its capacity to handle testing landscape.

              BUILDING HIGH-QUALITY VEHICLES WITH PRIDE. 
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
              Jeep Wranglers are typically built using body-on-frame construction,
              which means the body of the vehicle is mounted onto a separate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chassis">chassis</a>
              frame. This design provides strength and durability, making it well-suited
              for off-road driving. The body panels are usually made of steel for ruggedness,
              although some modern Wranglers feature aluminum components to reduce weight.
              Wranglers are also equipped with heavy-duty suspension systems, solid axles,
              and high ground clearance, all of which contribute to their off-road prowess.
              Additionally, they often come with specialized features such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skid_plate">skid plates</a>
              to protect vital components underneath the vehicle.
